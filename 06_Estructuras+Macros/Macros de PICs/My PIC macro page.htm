<P>I wrote a suite of assembly-language macros for use with the <A 
href="http://www.seanet.com/~karllunt/sites.htm">Microchip</A> MPASM assembler. 
&nbsp;I don't like writing PIC assembly language because of the twisted 
test-and-skip instructions, but I won't pay bucks for a C compiler and I don't 
intend to create an <A 
href="http://www.seanet.com/~karllunt/sbasic.htm">SBasic</A> for the PIC. 
&nbsp;This macro library is my second-best choice. &nbsp;For more details on 
using this library, see the July 1999 issue of <I><A 
href="http://www.seanet.com/~karllunt/nutsvolt.htm">Nuts &amp; Volts</A></I> 
magazine. 
<P>The library creates an assortment of structured programming elements, such as 
FOR-NEXT, SELECT-CASE, REPEAT-UNTIL, and REPEAT-ALWAYS. &nbsp;You can nest those 
elements to nearly any depth, and eliminate the need to manage a bunch of labels 
and goto instructions. &nbsp;The library also contains macros suited to use in 
the embedded control world, such as POLL-ENDPOLL, WAITWHILE, and WAITUNTIL.
